So for this challenge, you'll want to:
Create a new class, called Customer, with three fields:
name
credit limit
email address.
Create the getter methods only, for each field.  You don't need to create the setters.

 Create three constructors for this class:
 First, create a constructor for all three fields which should assign the arguments directly to the instance fields.
 Second, create a no args constructor that calls another constructor, passing some literal values for each argument.
 And lastly, create a constructor with just the name and email parameters, which also calls another constructor.
