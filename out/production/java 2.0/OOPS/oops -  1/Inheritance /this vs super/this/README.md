The keyword super is used to access or call the parent class members (variables and methods).
The keyword this is used to call the current class members (variables and methods).
this is required, when we have a parameter with the same name, as an instance variable or field.
NOTE: We can use either of them anywhere in a class, except for static elements, like a static method.  Any attempt to do so there, will lead to compile time errors.
